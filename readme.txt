== Installation ==

* Download the .zip of the plugin and extract the contents.
* Upload it to the Wordpress plugin directory and activate the plugin.
* Even easier, just go to <strong>Plugins > Add New</strong> and search for "Crayon".
* You can change settings and view help under <strong>Settings > Crayon</strong> in the Wordpress Admin.
* Make sure your theme either manually specifies jQuery, or uses the version shipped with Wordpress (recommended). You should NOT print out jQuery manually in the header as a script tag. <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1535/how-to-dequeue-a-script" target="_blank">Enqueueing it in Wordpresss</a> will prevent duplicate jQuery includes (also bad) and will allow other scripts to be placed AFTER jQuery in the head tag so they can use it. If you're uncertain, just let Wordpress handle it and remove any jQuery script tags you find in your theme's header.php.

= 1.15 =

    * The settings page no longer searches through all posts looking for legacy tags until you hit a new "refresh" button. Refreshing will look through all posts for crayon tags, and also mark any that are legacy tags. The same process occurs on an individual basis when saving a post.
    * The settings page shows which posts contains legacy tags, and the buttons do not hide when showing the table.
    * Added theme information to the settings page
    * Improved version updating
    * Code in a new window loses size constraints

    * By default "Display the Tag Editor in any TinyMCE instances on the frontend" is disabled to reduce resources
    * Chinese translation updated

= 1.14 =
* All AJAX functions are now using the wp_ajax action and admin-ajax.php method defined here: http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins. This means Crayon no longer passes around the wp_load path and doesn't use it as a $_GET variable to load AJAX requests. The security vulnerability in 1.13 is no longer present and that code has been removed.
* font-size and line-height has been removed from the crayon style CSS and is specified using the settings screen - the custom font size is enabled at 12px. This allows you to disable the custom font size and allow your own CSS to take control of the sizing for you. With the custom size disabled the inherited size is applied, so the code will appear at the size of its parent element based on your wordpress theme.
* Update functionality has been improved so the CrayonWP update function is only called when an update is detected from a change in the version string, not every time you load the page! If using lower than 1.14 the custom font size setting is enabled for you, since this setting was disabled by default in previous versions.
* Fixed a bug preventing Tag Editor from showing on the front end (related to the AJAX fix)
* Moved global js variables to the init functions which are called on ready()

= 1.12 =

* Fixed a bug causing posts with Crayon tags only in the comments (not the post content) to be ignored.

* Added the ability to specify <a href="http://aramk.com/blog/2012/09/02/line-ranges-in-crayon/" target="_blank">line ranges</a>

* Added Delphi/Pascal thanks to Chris McClenny (http://squashbrain.com/)

* Cleaned up crayon's js so it's not possible to overwrite the jQuery instance
* Fixed bug causing repeats of Crayon due to broken tags from using Mini Tags
* Fixed isses with ignoring Mini Tags with $
* Added Italian translation thanks to Federico Bellucci (http://www.federicobellucci.net/)

= 1.9.0 =
* This update is the biggest update yet - highly recommended for all users.
* Added a brand new Tag Editor in the Visual Editor toolbar! <strong>Greatly</strong> simplifies adding code to posts in the Visual Editor. You can also switch between Visual and HTML modes to verify your code before posting!
* Added ability to decode HTML entities, so now you can use &lt;, &gt; etc. in the Visual Editor. But if you need indentation etc, you'll want to use the HTML editor for posts with Crayons. You can also use decode="yes/no/true/false" to set this for an individual Crayon.
* Added ability to decode attributes, which is enabled by default to avoid seeing encoded strings in the title, and also to allow encoded angle/square brackets in the title that would otherwise clash with the Crayon tag brackets if left unencoded.
* Added ability to use the class attribute in &lt;pre&gt; tags for specifying settings like url, mark, lang, toolbar and all other valid settings like in a normal [crayon] tag. This will ensure your &lt;pre&gt; tags remain valid XHTML markup even with Crayon disabled.
* Added ability to specify hyphen-separated-values in the class attribute of a &lt;pre&gt; tag to make them look like actual class selectors. E.g. &lt;pre class="lang-objc toolbar-false"&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;. The setting name is made up of letters and hyphens ONLY, the value is whatever is left between the last hyphen and the next whitespace character.
* Added Scheme language thanks to https://github.com/harry75369
* Added ABAP language with help from Christian Fein
* Added a new setting: crayon="false/no/0" as an attribute or crayon:false in the class tag of a &lt;pre&gt;. This will ignore the &lt;pre&gt; tag and not turn it into a Crayon for those rare cases you don't want to use the plugin.
* Improved the method of finding posts with Crayons - now it will search through all posts for Crayons and save the ids in the options db. When the_posts is called, it won't need to do any extra searching on page loading and will already know which post has Crayons. Like before, pages which might use page templates will turn off enqueuing of fonts and themes to ensure they are always printed.
* Overriden Language File elements are now put first in the CSS class name, so the extended element can override in a theme
* Prevented capturing Crayons in the admin
* Crayons now use HTML5 valid markup
* I'm still sticking to the wrap="off" for no-wrapping preformatted styling - CSS doesn't do the trick yet: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/657795/how-remove-wordwrap-from-textarea
* Improved ajax handling
* Cleaned up the settings screen
* Line numbers now use UID in id to avoid duplicates
* Crayon CSS updated to use inline styles and never use style tags in the body
* Simplified the toolbar buttons to suit the minimalistic design of the rest of Crayon. It'll look badass with an inset shadow in a future theme...
* Plain tags are now just &lt;pre&gt; tags and don't contain the inline code tag since they are block tags.
* Fixed a MAJOR bug preventing previously captured Crayons from being applied to post content!
* Fixed a bug causing case insensitive Boolean settings to fail at times
* Fixed a bug causing a [crayon ... /] tags to be recognised as [c ... /] tags (added a \b)
* Fixed a bug preventing highlight="false" from working
* Fixed a bug preventing mouse events for showing plain code when toolbar is always hidden

* &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags are now captured as Crayons. This can be turned off in Settings > Crayon > Code.
* You can remove prevent capturing individual &lt;pre&gt; tags the same way as Crayons: $&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;
* This method of preventing the &lt;pre&gt; tag should be used if your code contains &lt;pre&gt; tags (nested &lt;pre&gt; tags) - otherwise it will cause conflicts.
* Keep in mind that &lt;pre&gt; tags should not be editted in Visual Mode. Crayon will display all code as it appears in the HTML view of the post editor, where you can make code changes and use the tab key etc. If you want to use the Visual editor reguarly and are running into problems, consider loading the code form a file using the 'url' attribute.
* I have removed the ability to have spacing between the starting and ending square brackets, so [crayon...] is valid but [ crayon ... ] is not.
The same applies to &lt;pre&gt; tags (not &lt; pre &gt;). The reason is to improve performance on posts without Crayons by using strpos and not regex functions like preg_match, and also it's better formed.

= 1.6.0 =
